# ðŸŽ“ Predicting Student Academic Performance using ML & DL

This project compares classical machine learning and deep learning approaches 
for predicting student final grades based on behavioral, social, and academic data.

##  Contents
- `student_performance_notebook.ipynb` â€“ Full analysis and modeling.
- `report/Student_Performance_Report.pdf` â€“ Written report (3,500â€“5,000 words).
- `artifacts/` â€“ Saved models, plots, and results.
- `data/` â€“ Dataset (Student Alcohol Consumption dataset, UCI/Kaggle).
- `presentation/` â€“ 5â€“10 minute recorded presentation video.

##  Dataset
**Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Student Alcohol Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)

##  Methods
- **Classical ML:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  
- **Deep Learning:** Sequential & Functional Neural Networks (TensorFlow/Keras)

##  Results
Random Forest achieved the best predictive performance (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.88, RMSE â‰ˆ 1.2).  
Neural Networks showed similar results with more variance.
