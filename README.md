# Predicting Student Academic Performance using ML & DL

This project compares classical machine learning and deep learning approaches 
for predicting student final grades based on behavioral, social, and academic data.

##  Dataset
**Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Student Alcohol Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)

##  Methods
- **Classical ML:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  
- **Deep Learning:** Sequential & Functional Neural Networks (TensorFlow/Keras)

##  Results
Random Forest achieved the best predictive performance (R² ≈ 0.88, RMSE ≈ 1.2).  
Neural Networks showed similar results with more variance.
